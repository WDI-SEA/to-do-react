## Review

So, we've gone through all of the basics of React. To really hammer it home with practice, let's walk through complete creation of an app. This will be a to-do list, keeping track of everything we need to do for the day (after we finish this!). It's a lot, so we're going to want it to be editable.

This is what our list will look like when we're finished:

![finished-list](./images/todo-list-finished.png)

Let's get started!

- Fork & Clone
- run `npm i` to install dependencies

Use `npm start` to start a server that will serve your new React application!

```sh
npm start
```

- Check it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, you should have a fresh react app.

- Make sure that as you go, you frequently check the site to ensure your changes are all reflecting accurately!

## Set up App.js for a class component.

Let's name the component in `App.js` to something more meaningful, like `MyList`. Also change the name of the file from `App.js` to `MyList.js`, since best practices include keeping the file name the same as the component it contains as often as possible.

Then, we'll replace the functional component with a class component and put the appropriate import statement at the top.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import './App.css'

class MyList extends Component {
  render() {
    return ()
  }
}

export default MyList
```

## Fix index.js to display MyList.

Change the name of the component where it's rendered in index.js! You'll also have to change the `import` statement in `index.js`, since you changed the name of the file containing the component that `index.js` is importing from!

`index.js` now looks like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import MyList from "./MyList";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.render(<MyList />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Set up the basic list.

Now change the contents of the HTML to have a header and the start of a list.

This looks like:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";

class MyList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1> Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyList;
```

Now, our webpage displays an empty list.

We've learned that we should make new files for each component and that different functionalities should be split into different components.

Let's make a component for `ListItem`s. This component can simply render `<li>Make the list!</li>` so that we are starting with something in this list.

- Remember to use an `export` statement at the end of the new file to make the code in this file available elsewhere in our application.

- Don't forget to import your `ListItem` component into `MyList.js`. Then, include the component in what `MyList` renders with `<ListItem />` under the existing header (in place of the existing list item)!

**ListItem.js**

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";

class ListItem extends Component {
  render() {
    return <li>Make the list!</li>;
  }
}

export default ListItem;
```

**MyList.js**

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import ListItem from "./ListItem";

class MyList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
        <ul>
          <ListItem />
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyList;
```

At this point, our app looks like this:

![list-preview](https://res.cloudinary.com/doc2wnnmb/image/upload/v1638222379/todo-list-1_xejevl.png)

## Side note - let's quickly format it a little more nicely!

Since we'll be looking at this for a while, let's make it less of an eyesore. Feel free to change the `index.css` file to include anything you'd like; on mine, I've centered the text and given it a light green background. You can grab mine [here](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/react_state_exercises_global/blob/master/images/index.css).

## Second, props.

This is a great start - we've already nested components (`ListItem` inside of `MyList`). Now, let's add some props to make this useful and check that current list item off!

Let's first just pass a prop into `ListItem` from `MyList`. We'll call the prop something simple, like `doThis`. I'm pretty hungry; I'll pass in a value of "buy ice cream."

Then, in `ListItem`, we'll add a list item that uses the `doThis` prop instead of the existing hard-coded text.

Now, we have in `MyList.js`:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import ListItem from "./ListItem";

class MyList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
        <ul>
          <ListItem task="Buy ice cream" />
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyList;
```

Now that we've passed in a prop to `ListItem`, we need to call it in `ListItem.js`
using `this.props`

`ListItem.js` will now look like this:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";

class ListItem extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <li>{this.props.task}</li>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ListItem;
```

Our app now looks like this:
![list-preview](./images/todo-list-2.png)

## Third, render different items in an array.

If we want to make this a truly extensible list, we could create an array of items, pass them into props through the `ListItem` component, and then render each item. Let's do that now.

Borrowing from a bonus exercise earlier, the easiest way to do this is by using the `map` function. A map is like a `for` loop. With `map`, you make a new variable and iterate through each item in an array with it. It looks like this:

```js
let newArray = oldArray.map((item, index) => {
  /* how to change each item in the array */
});
```

Here's a simple example that makes a new array by adding an `!` to each element of an array.

```js
const phrases = ["ice cream", "dinosaurs", "hobbits"];
let excitedPhrases = phrases.map((phrase, index) => {
  return (newPhrase = phrase + "!");
});
// excitedPhrases is ["ice cream!", "dinosaurs!", "hobbits!"]
```

> Note that in the above example, moustaches are used after the arrow rather than the open parentheses in the earlier example.
> In ES6, with arrow functions, you can omit the curly brackets and `return` keyword if the return value can be written as a single statement. In the same way that we `return` a single HTML element in a component's `render()` function, we can place this single-statement return value in parentheses and make use of line-breaks without confusing javascript.

##### Plan

- In the `MyList` component, have an array of items for the list—uncreatively called `theList`—that is passed down from `index.js` in the form of a prop
- Create a variable to refer to the new array output by the `map` method, uncreatively but helpfully called `todoItems`.
- Use `map` to iterate through the `todoItems` array, one `item` (this could be any name you'd like) at a time, and use each one to create a `ListItem` component in the `todoItems` list.
- We can later refer to this list by just calling the variable in JSX (like any other variable). For example, we could say `{todoItems}`.

##### Implementing the Plan

First, let's make our list in `index.js`. Make an array of strings that represent your todo items.
Fill it with what you need to do for the day. Once you've done that, pass that array into your
`<MyList />` component.

Your `index.js` should look something like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import MyList from "./MyList";
import "./index.css";

const toDos = ["Listen to Hot Mulligan", "Drink hot cocoa", "Eat hot cheetos"];

ReactDOM.render(<MyList theList={toDos} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

The next step is to use the `map` function to create an array of `<ListItem />`s, each with
its own `doThis` prop that represents a todo item from `theList`.

Here is the `map` function call that will do this for us, which we'll put in the `MyList` component:

```js
let todoItems = this.props.theList.map((item, index) => (
  <ListItem task={item} key={index} />
));
```

The last step is to call the `todoItems` in the render function of `MyList` class.

My final `MyList` component class looks like this:

```js
class MyList extends Component {
  render() {
    let todoItems = this.props.theList.map((item, index) => {
      return <ListItem task={item} key={index} />;
    });

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
        <ul>{todoItems}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

And the final `ListItem.js`, which hasn't changed:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";

class ListItem extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <li>{this.props.task}</li>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ListItem;
```

Now what we have is:
